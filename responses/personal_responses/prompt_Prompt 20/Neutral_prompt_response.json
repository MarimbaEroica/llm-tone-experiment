    "response": "One self-care practice that helps me unwind after a long day is taking a warm bath with Epsom salts and essential oils. I fill the tub with warm water, add a cup of Epsom salts, and a few drops of lavender or chamomile essential oil. The warm water and Epsom salts help to relax my muscles and relieve any tension or soreness from the day. The calming scent of the essential oils helps to soothe my mind and promote relaxation. I like to dim the lights, play some soft music, and just soak in the bath for about 20-30 minutes. It's a wonderful way to unwind, release stress, and prepare myself for a restful night's sleep."
