I find that the warm water helps to relax my muscles and the Epsom salts can help to relieve any tension or soreness. Adding a few drops of lavender or chamomile essential oil creates a calming and soothing atmosphere, which helps to promote relaxation and reduce stress. I also like to dim the lights, play some soft music, and take this time to disconnect from technology and simply focus on being present in the moment. It's a simple yet effective way for me to unwind, release any built-up stress, and prepare myself for a restful night's sleep."
