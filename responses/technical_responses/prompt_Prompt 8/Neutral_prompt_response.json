    "response": "The structure of DNA is a double helix, which resembles a twisted ladder or spiral staircase. It consists of two long strands of nucleotides that are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs. The nucleotides are made up of three components: a sugar molecule called deoxyribose, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.\n\nThe two strands of DNA run in opposite directions, with one strand running in the 5' to 3' direction and the other running in the 3' to 5' direction. The sugar-phosphate backbone of each strand forms the outer edges of the helix, while the nitrogenous bases are stacked in the center.\n\nThere are four different nitrogenous bases in DNA: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). Adenine pairs with thymine, and cytosine pairs with guanine, forming base pairs. These base pairs are connected by hydrogen bonds, with A-T forming two hydrogen bonds and C-G forming three hydrogen bonds.\n\nThe specific sequence of base pairs along the DNA molecule is what encodes genetic information. This sequence determines the order of amino acids in proteins, which are the building blocks of cells and perform various functions in the body."
