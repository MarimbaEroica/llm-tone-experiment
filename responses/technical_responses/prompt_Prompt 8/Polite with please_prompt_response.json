    "response": "DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a double-stranded molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all known living organisms. It has a unique structure that consists of two long chains of nucleotides twisted into a double helix.\n\nThe basic building blocks of DNA are nucleotides, which are composed of three components: a sugar molecule called deoxyribose, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. There are four types of nitrogenous bases in DNA: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G).\n\nThe two DNA strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases. Adenine always pairs with thymine, forming two hydrogen bonds, while cytosine always pairs with guanine, forming three hydrogen bonds. This complementary base pairing is known as Chargaff's rules.\n\nThe two DNA strands run in opposite directions, with one strand running in the 5' to 3' direction and the other running in the 3' to 5' direction. This arrangement is referred to as antiparallel.\n\nThe double helix structure of DNA is stabilized by the twisting of the two strands around each other in a right-handed manner. The sugar-phosphate backbones of the two strands are on the outside, while the nitrogenous bases are stacked in the interior.\n\nThe DNA molecule is further organized into higher levels of structure. Short segments of DNA, called genes, contain the instructions for making proteins. Genes are organized into chromosomes, which are long strands of DNA that are tightly coiled and condensed.\n\nOverall, the structure of DNA is crucial for its function as the carrier of genetic information, allowing for the replication and transmission of genetic material from one generation to the next."
