    "response": "Igneous rocks are formed through the solidification and crystallization of molten rock material, known as magma or lava. The process of formation involves several stages:\n\n1. Melting: Igneous rocks originate from the melting of pre-existing rocks in the Earth's mantle or crust. The melting can occur due to various factors such as increased temperature, decrease in pressure, or the addition of volatiles (water, carbon dioxide, etc.).\n\n2. Magma Formation: When rocks melt, they form a molten material called magma. Magma is a mixture of liquid rock, dissolved gases, and solid mineral crystals. It is less dense than the surrounding rocks, so it rises towards the Earth's surface through cracks and fractures.\n\n3. Cooling and Crystallization: As magma rises, it encounters cooler temperatures in the Earth's crust or reaches the surface as lava during volcanic eruptions. The cooling of magma or lava leads to the solidification of the molten material. The rate of cooling determines the size of the mineral crystals formed. Slow cooling allows larger crystals to develop, while rapid cooling results in smaller crystals or even glassy textures.\n\n4. Mineral Formation: During the cooling and solidification process, minerals within the magma begin to crystallize. The specific minerals that form depend on the chemical composition of the magma. Silicate minerals, such as feldspar, quartz, and mica, are commonly found in igneous rocks. The composition of the magma also influences the color and texture of the resulting rock.\n\n5. Intrusive and Extrusive Rocks: Igneous rocks can be classified into two main types based on their formation location. Intrusive rocks, also known as plutonic rocks, form when magma cools and solidifies slowly beneath the Earth's surface. This slow cooling allows for the growth of large mineral crystals, resulting in coarse-grained rocks like granite. Extrusive rocks, on the other hand, form when lava erupts onto the Earth's surface and cools rapidly. This rapid cooling prevents the growth of large crystals, resulting in fine-grained rocks like basalt.\n\nOverall, the formation of igneous rocks is a result of the complex processes of melting, magma formation, cooling, and crystallization. The specific conditions and composition of the magma determine the type and characteristics of the igneous rock that ultimately forms."
