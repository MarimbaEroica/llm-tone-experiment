    "response": "Igneous rocks are formed through the solidification and crystallization of molten rock material, known as magma or lava. The formation of igneous rocks can occur both beneath the Earth's surface and on its surface.\n\n1. Magma Formation: Magma is formed when the temperature and pressure conditions within the Earth's mantle cause the melting of pre-existing rocks. This can occur due to the increase in temperature with depth or the addition of heat from nearby magma bodies. The composition of the magma depends on the original rock that melted and the subsequent processes of partial melting and fractional crystallization.\n\n2. Intrusive Igneous Rocks: When magma rises towards the Earth's surface but does not erupt, it cools and solidifies slowly beneath the surface. This results in the formation of intrusive igneous rocks, also known as plutonic rocks. The slow cooling allows for the growth of large mineral crystals, giving these rocks a coarse-grained texture. Examples of intrusive igneous rocks include granite, diorite, and gabbro.\n\n3. Extrusive Igneous Rocks: When magma reaches the Earth's surface through volcanic eruptions, it is called lava. Lava cools rapidly in contact with the atmosphere or water, resulting in the formation of extrusive igneous rocks, also known as volcanic rocks. The rapid cooling prevents the growth of large mineral crystals, giving these rocks a fine-grained or glassy texture. Examples of extrusive igneous rocks include basalt, andesite, and rhyolite.\n\n4. Vesicular Igneous Rocks: If the lava contains dissolved gases, such as water vapor or carbon dioxide, these gases can escape during the rapid cooling process, creating voids or gas bubbles within the rock. This results in the formation of vesicular igneous rocks, which have a spongy appearance due to the presence of these vesicles. Examples of vesicular igneous rocks include pumice and scoria.\n\n5. Volcanic Glass: In some cases, lava can cool so rapidly that no mineral crystals have time to form. This results in the formation of volcanic glass, such as obsidian. Volcanic glass has a smooth, shiny appearance and lacks any crystalline structure.\n\nOverall, the formation of igneous rocks is a result of the cooling and solidification of magma or lava, with the specific conditions of cooling determining the texture and composition of the resulting rock."
