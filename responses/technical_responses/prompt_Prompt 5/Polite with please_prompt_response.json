    "response": "Igneous rocks are formed through the solidification and crystallization of molten rock material, known as magma or lava. The formation process involves several stages:\n\n1. Melting: Igneous rocks originate from the melting of pre-existing rocks in the Earth's mantle or crust. This can occur due to high temperatures, changes in pressure, or the addition of volatiles (such as water) that lower the melting point of the rocks.\n\n2. Magma Formation: When rocks melt, they form a molten material called magma. Magma is a mixture of liquid rock, dissolved gases, and solid mineral crystals. It is less dense than the surrounding rocks, so it rises towards the Earth's surface through cracks and fractures.\n\n3. Cooling and Crystallization: As magma rises, it encounters cooler temperatures in the Earth's crust or is extruded onto the surface as lava during volcanic eruptions. The cooling of magma or lava causes the minerals within it to crystallize and solidify. The rate of cooling determines the size of the mineral crystals. Slow cooling allows for larger crystals to form, while rapid cooling results in smaller crystals or even glassy textures.\n\n4. Intrusive and Extrusive Rocks: Igneous rocks can be classified into two main types based on their formation location. Intrusive igneous rocks, also known as plutonic rocks, form when magma cools and solidifies slowly beneath the Earth's surface. This slow cooling allows for the growth of large mineral crystals, resulting in coarse-grained textures. Examples of intrusive rocks include granite and diorite.\n\nOn the other hand, extrusive igneous rocks, also called volcanic rocks, form when magma erupts onto the Earth's surface as lava and rapidly cools. The quick cooling prevents the growth of large crystals, resulting in fine-grained or even glassy textures. Examples of extrusive rocks include basalt and rhyolite.\n\n5. Composition: The composition of igneous rocks is determined by the minerals present in the original magma. Magma can be composed of various combinations of minerals, such as feldspar, quartz, mica, and pyroxene. The relative proportions of these minerals in the magma influence the final composition and characteristics of the igneous rock.\n\nOverall, the formation of igneous rocks involves the melting, cooling, and crystallization of magma or lava. The specific conditions and processes during this formation determine the texture, composition, and appearance of the resulting igneous rocks."
