    "response": "Mitosis is the process by which a eukaryotic cell divides to produce two identical daughter cells. It is a crucial part of the cell cycle and is responsible for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in multicellular organisms.\n\nThe process of mitosis can be divided into several distinct stages:\n\n1. Interphase: This is the phase before mitosis where the cell prepares for division. During interphase, the cell grows, replicates its DNA, and carries out normal cellular functions.\n\n2. Prophase: In this stage, the chromatin (loosely packed DNA) condenses into visible chromosomes. The nuclear membrane starts to break down, and the centrosomes, which contain the centrioles, move to opposite poles of the cell. Microtubules called spindle fibers begin to form between the centrosomes.\n\n3. Prometaphase: The nuclear membrane completely disintegrates, and the spindle fibers attach to the chromosomes at specific regions called kinetochores. Each chromosome has two sister chromatids held together by a centromere.\n\n4. Metaphase: The chromosomes align along the equatorial plane of the cell, known as the metaphase plate. The spindle fibers from opposite poles attach to the kinetochores of each chromosome, ensuring proper alignment.\n\n5. Anaphase: The centromeres split, separating the sister chromatids. The spindle fibers shorten and pull the sister chromatids towards opposite poles of the cell. This ensures that each daughter cell will receive an identical set of chromosomes.\n\n6. Telophase: The separated chromosomes reach the opposite poles of the cell. The spindle fibers disassemble, and a new nuclear membrane forms around each set of chromosomes, creating two nuclei.\n\n7. Cytokinesis: This is the final stage of mitosis, where the cytoplasm divides to form two separate daughter cells. In animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms and pinches the cell membrane inward until it completely separates. In plant cells, a cell plate forms in the middle of the cell and gradually develops into a new cell wall.\n\nAfter cytokinesis, each daughter cell enters interphase and the cell cycle continues. The two daughter cells are genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell, as they have received an identical set of chromosomes."
