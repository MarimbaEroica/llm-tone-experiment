    "response": "Mitosis is the process by which a cell divides and produces two identical daughter cells. It is a crucial process for growth, repair, and maintenance of multicellular organisms. The process of mitosis can be divided into several distinct stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.\n\n1. Prophase: During prophase, the chromatin in the nucleus condenses and becomes visible as distinct chromosomes. The nuclear membrane also begins to break down, and the centrioles move to opposite poles of the cell. Spindle fibers, made of microtubules, start to form and extend from the centrioles.\n\n2. Metaphase: In metaphase, the chromosomes line up along the equator of the cell, known as the metaphase plate. The spindle fibers attach to the centromere region of each chromosome, ensuring that they are properly aligned.\n\n3. Anaphase: During anaphase, the spindle fibers contract and pull the sister chromatids apart. The separated chromatids, now called chromosomes, move towards opposite poles of the cell. This ensures that each daughter cell will receive an identical set of chromosomes.\n\n4. Telophase: Telophase marks the final stage of mitosis. The chromosomes reach the opposite poles of the cell, and a new nuclear membrane begins to form around each set of chromosomes. The chromosomes begin to decondense back into chromatin, and the spindle fibers disassemble. The cell starts to elongate in preparation for division.\n\n5. Cytokinesis: Cytokinesis is the final step of cell division, which occurs after mitosis. In animal cells, a cleavage furrow forms, and the cell membrane pinches inward, eventually dividing the cytoplasm into two separate cells. In plant cells, a cell plate forms in the middle of the cell, which eventually develops into a new cell wall, dividing the cytoplasm.\n\nOverall, mitosis ensures that each daughter cell receives an identical copy of the genetic material present in the parent cell. This process is essential for growth, development, and tissue repair in multicellular organisms."
