    "response": "Mitosis is a process of cell division that occurs in eukaryotic cells, resulting in the formation of two identical daughter cells. It is a crucial process for growth, development, and tissue repair in multicellular organisms. The process of mitosis can be divided into several distinct stages: prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.\n\n1. Prophase: During prophase, the chromatin (loosely packed DNA) in the nucleus condenses into visible chromosomes. Each chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids held together by a structure called the centromere. The nuclear envelope starts to break down, and the centrosomes, which contain the centrioles, move to opposite poles of the cell.\n\n2. Prometaphase: In prometaphase, the nuclear envelope completely disintegrates, and the microtubules of the mitotic spindle start to form. The centrosomes at each pole of the cell begin to grow microtubules called spindle fibers, which extend towards the center of the cell. Some of these spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores, protein structures located at the centromere region of each chromosome.\n\n3. Metaphase: During metaphase, the spindle fibers align the chromosomes along the equatorial plane of the cell, known as the metaphase plate. This alignment ensures that each daughter cell will receive an equal number of chromosomes. The chromosomes are held in place by the tension exerted by the spindle fibers attached to the kinetochores.\n\n4. Anaphase: In anaphase, the centromeres holding the sister chromatids together split, separating the chromatids into individual chromosomes. The spindle fibers attached to the kinetochores shorten, pulling the chromosomes towards opposite poles of the cell. This movement ensures that each daughter cell will receive a complete set of chromosomes.\n\n5. Telophase: During telophase, the chromosomes reach the opposite poles of the cell. The spindle fibers disassemble, and a new nuclear envelope forms around each set of chromosomes, reorganizing them into distinct nuclei. The chromosomes begin to decondense back into chromatin, and the cell starts to prepare for cytokinesis.\n\n6. Cytokinesis: Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division, where the cytoplasm of the parent cell divides to form two separate daughter cells. In animal cells, a contractile ring composed of actin filaments forms around the equator of the cell, constricting and eventually pinching the cell membrane to form a cleavage furrow. This furrow deepens until the cell is divided into two daughter cells. In plant cells, a cell plate forms in the middle of the cell, which eventually develops into a new cell wall, separating the two daughter cells.\n\nAfter cytokinesis, the two daughter cells enter the interphase, where they grow, replicate their DNA, and prepare for the next round of cell division. This process of mitosis ensures the accurate distribution of genetic material and the formation of genetically identical daughter cells."
