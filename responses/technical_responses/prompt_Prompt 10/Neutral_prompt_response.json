    "response": "The function of chlorophyll in plants is to absorb light energy from the sun and convert it into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. Chlorophyll is responsible for capturing light in the chloroplasts of plant cells and using it to produce glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. This process is essential for the plant's growth and survival, as glucose is used as a source of energy for various cellular processes, and oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct. Additionally, chlorophyll gives plants their green color."
