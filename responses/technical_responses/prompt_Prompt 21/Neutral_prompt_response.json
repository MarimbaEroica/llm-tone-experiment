    "response": "Osmosis is the process by which water molecules move across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration. This movement of water occurs in order to equalize the concentration of solutes on both sides of the membrane.\n\nThe process of osmosis can be explained using the example of a cell placed in a solution. If the solution outside the cell has a higher concentration of solutes compared to the inside of the cell, it is considered a hypertonic solution. In this case, water molecules will move out of the cell through the cell membrane in order to dilute the higher concentration of solutes outside. This causes the cell to shrink or become flaccid.\n\nOn the other hand, if the solution outside the cell has a lower concentration of solutes compared to the inside of the cell, it is considered a hypotonic solution. In this case, water molecules will move into the cell through the cell membrane in order to dilute the higher concentration of solutes inside. This causes the cell to swell or become turgid.\n\nIf the concentration of solutes is equal on both sides of the membrane, the solution is considered isotonic. In this case, there is no net movement of water molecules, and the cell remains in its normal state.\n\nOsmosis is a passive process, meaning it does not require energy expenditure by the cell. It is driven by the concentration gradient of solutes across the membrane. The selectively permeable membrane allows water molecules to pass through, but restricts the movement of solute particles. This allows for the movement of water to occur until equilibrium is reached."
