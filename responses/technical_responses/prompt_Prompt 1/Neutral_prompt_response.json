    "response": "The theory of relativity is a scientific theory developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century. It consists of two major parts: the special theory of relativity and the general theory of relativity.\n\nThe special theory of relativity, published by Einstein in 1905, is based on two postulates: the laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames (frames of reference moving at a constant velocity relative to each other), and the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. This theory revolutionized our understanding of space and time by introducing the concept of spacetime, where space and time are not separate entities but are interconnected. It also introduced the idea of time dilation, where time can appear to pass differently for observers in relative motion.\n\nThe general theory of relativity, published by Einstein in 1915, extends the special theory of relativity to include gravity. It proposes that gravity is not a force but rather a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. According to this theory, objects with mass or energy cause spacetime to curve, and other objects move along the curved paths created by this curvature. The general theory of relativity has been confirmed by numerous experiments and observations, including the bending of light around massive objects and the existence of black holes.\n\nOverall, the theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of the fundamental nature of space, time, and gravity, and it has had a profound impact on many areas of physics and cosmology."
