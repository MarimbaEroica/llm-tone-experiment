    "response": "The Eiffel Tower, one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, has a rich history that dates back to the late 19th century.\n\nThe idea for the Eiffel Tower originated as part of preparations for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World's Fair) held in Paris to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. The French government announced a competition to design an iron tower that would stand on the Champ de Mars, a large public greenspace near the Seine River.\n\nThe winning design came from Gustave Eiffel, a renowned French engineer. Eiffel, along with his team of engineers, including Maurice Koechlin and \u00c9mile Nouguier, created a design that was both innovative and structurally sound. The tower was to be made of iron and would stand 300 meters (984 feet) tall, making it the tallest man-made structure at the time.\n\nConstruction of the Eiffel Tower began in 1887 and took just over two years to complete. The tower was assembled using over 18,000 individual iron pieces and held together by over 2.5 million rivets. The construction process faced some opposition from artists and intellectuals who considered the tower to be an eyesore and a symbol of modernity that clashed with the traditional architecture of Paris.\n\nDespite the initial criticism, the Eiffel Tower was completed in March 1889 and officially opened to the public on March 31 of the same year. It quickly became a sensation and attracted millions of visitors during the Exposition Universelle. Initially, the tower was intended to be a temporary structure and was scheduled to be dismantled after 20 years. However, it was repurposed as a radio transmission tower, which saved it from demolition.\n\nOver the years, the Eiffel Tower has served various purposes. During World War I, it was used for intercepting enemy radio communications. In the 1920s and 1930s, it became a popular site for scientific experiments and radio broadcasts. Today, it serves as a major tourist attraction, offering breathtaking views of Paris from its observation decks.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower has also undergone several renovations and modifications. In the early 20th century, a meteorological laboratory was added to the top of the tower. In the 1980s, glass-walled elevators were installed, and in 2000, a glass floor was added to the first level, providing visitors with a unique perspective of the structure.\n\nThroughout its history, the Eiffel Tower has become an enduring symbol of Paris and a testament to human engineering and architectural prowess. It continues to captivate visitors from around the world and remains an iconic landmark of France."
