    "response": "The circulatory system, also known as the cardiovascular system, is responsible for transporting blood, oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and other essential substances throughout the body. It consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood.\n\nThe process begins with the heart, which acts as a pump. It has four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. The right side of the heart receives deoxygenated blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation, while the left side receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body.\n\nDeoxygenated blood enters the right atrium from the body through the superior and inferior vena cava. From there, it flows into the right ventricle, which contracts to pump the blood into the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery carries the blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide through the process of respiration.\n\nOxygenated blood returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins, entering the left atrium. It then flows into the left ventricle, which contracts to pump the blood into the aorta, the largest artery in the body. From the aorta, the oxygenated blood is distributed to all the organs, tissues, and cells of the body through a network of blood vessels.\n\nThe blood vessels can be categorized into three types: arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the body's tissues, while veins carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart. Capillaries are tiny, thin-walled vessels that connect arteries and veins, allowing for the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between the blood and the surrounding tissues.\n\nAs the blood flows through the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients are delivered to the cells, and waste products, such as carbon dioxide, are picked up. The deoxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the veins, starting the cycle again.\n\nThe circulatory system also plays a role in regulating body temperature, pH balance, and immune responses. It is a vital system that ensures the proper functioning of all organs and tissues in the body."
