    "response": "The function of the nervous system is to transmit signals between different parts of the body, allowing for communication and coordination of various bodily functions. It is responsible for receiving sensory input from the environment, processing and interpreting that information, and initiating appropriate responses. The nervous system also plays a role in regulating and maintaining homeostasis, controlling voluntary and involuntary movements, and facilitating cognitive processes such as learning and memory."
