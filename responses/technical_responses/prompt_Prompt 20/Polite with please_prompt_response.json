    "response": "The nervous system is a complex network of nerves and cells that transmit signals between different parts of the body. Its main function is to coordinate and control the activities of the body's different organs and systems, allowing them to work together and respond to internal and external stimuli.\n\nThe nervous system can be divided into two main parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS consists of the brain and spinal cord, while the PNS includes all the nerves that extend from the CNS to the rest of the body.\n\nThe nervous system performs several important functions:\n\n1. Sensory input: It receives information from sensory organs and receptors, such as the eyes, ears, skin, and internal organs. This input is then transmitted to the brain for processing.\n\n2. Integration: The brain processes and interprets the sensory information received, allowing us to make sense of our surroundings and respond appropriately. It integrates information from different sources and coordinates the body's response.\n\n3. Motor output: The nervous system sends signals from the brain to the muscles and glands, enabling voluntary and involuntary movements. It controls muscle contractions, allowing us to move, speak, and perform various actions.\n\n4. Homeostasis: The nervous system helps maintain the body's internal balance, or homeostasis. It regulates vital functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and respiration to ensure optimal functioning.\n\n5. Higher cognitive functions: The nervous system is responsible for higher cognitive functions such as memory, learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. It enables us to think, process information, and make decisions.\n\nOverall, the nervous system plays a crucial role in coordinating and controlling the body's functions, allowing us to interact with our environment and maintain our overall well-being."
