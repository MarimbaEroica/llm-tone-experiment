    "response": "The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect the body from harmful pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Its primary function is to identify and eliminate these foreign invaders while also distinguishing them from the body's own healthy cells.\n\nThe immune system has two main components: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system.\n\n1. Innate Immune System: This is the first line of defense and provides immediate, non-specific protection against a wide range of pathogens. It includes physical barriers like the skin and mucous membranes, as well as various cells and molecules that recognize and destroy pathogens. These cells include phagocytes (such as neutrophils and macrophages) that engulf and destroy pathogens, natural killer cells that kill infected cells, and dendritic cells that present antigens to activate the adaptive immune response. The innate immune system also releases chemical signals called cytokines to recruit more immune cells to the site of infection and initiate an inflammatory response.\n\n2. Adaptive Immune System: This is a more specific and targeted response that develops over time. It recognizes and remembers specific pathogens, allowing for a faster and more effective response upon subsequent exposure. The adaptive immune system involves two main types of cells: B cells and T cells.\n\n- B cells produce antibodies, which are proteins that bind to specific antigens (molecules on the surface of pathogens) and neutralize them. Antibodies can also mark pathogens for destruction by other immune cells.\n- T cells have different functions, including helper T cells that coordinate the immune response, cytotoxic T cells that directly kill infected cells, and regulatory T cells that help prevent excessive immune responses.\n\nThe adaptive immune system also involves memory cells, which \"remember\" specific pathogens encountered in the past. This memory allows for a quicker and more efficient response upon re-exposure to the same pathogen.\n\nOverall, the immune system works to protect the body by recognizing and eliminating pathogens, preventing their spread, and promoting healing and recovery. It is a highly coordinated and dynamic system that plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and well-being."
