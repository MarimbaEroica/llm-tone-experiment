    "response": "Protein synthesis is the process by which cells build proteins. It involves two main steps: transcription and translation.\n\n1. Transcription:\n   - The first step is the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA) from a DNA template. This process occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells and the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells.\n   - The enzyme RNA polymerase binds to a specific region of the DNA called the promoter, which signals the start of a gene.\n   - The DNA double helix unwinds, and the RNA polymerase synthesizes a complementary mRNA strand using one of the DNA strands as a template.\n   - The mRNA molecule is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, with the RNA polymerase adding nucleotides (A, U, G, and C) to the growing mRNA chain according to the DNA template.\n   - Once the mRNA molecule is synthesized, it undergoes post-transcriptional modifications, including the addition of a 5' cap and a poly-A tail, as well as the removal of introns (non-coding regions) through a process called splicing.\n\n2. Translation:\n   - The second step is the synthesis of a protein from the mRNA template. This process occurs in the cytoplasm, specifically on ribosomes.\n   - The mRNA molecule binds to a ribosome, and the process begins with the initiation phase.\n   - The ribosome recognizes a specific start codon (usually AUG) on the mRNA, and a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule carrying the corresponding amino acid (methionine in the case of AUG) binds to the ribosome.\n   - Elongation is the next phase, where additional tRNA molecules bind to the ribosome, bringing in their specific amino acids. The ribosome catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds between adjacent amino acids, creating a growing polypeptide chain.\n   - The ribosome moves along the mRNA molecule, reading the codons (three-nucleotide sequences) and bringing in the corresponding tRNA molecules with their amino acids.\n   - This process continues until a stop codon is reached on the mRNA, signaling the termination of translation.\n   - The newly synthesized polypeptide chain is released from the ribosome and undergoes post-translational modifications, such as folding, cleavage, and addition of chemical groups, to form a functional protein.\n\nOverall, protein synthesis involves the conversion of genetic information encoded in DNA into functional proteins through the processes of transcription and translation."
