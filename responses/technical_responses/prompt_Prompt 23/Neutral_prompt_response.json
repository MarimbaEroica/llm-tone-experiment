    "response": "Protein synthesis is the process by which cells build proteins. It involves two main steps: transcription and translation.\n\n1. Transcription: This step takes place in the nucleus of the cell. The DNA sequence of a gene is first transcribed into a complementary RNA molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). The enzyme RNA polymerase binds to the DNA at the start of the gene and unwinds the double helix. It then uses one strand of the DNA as a template to synthesize a complementary mRNA molecule. The mRNA molecule is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, with the RNA polymerase adding nucleotides to the growing mRNA chain. The mRNA molecule is complementary to the DNA template strand, with the exception that thymine (T) in DNA is replaced by uracil (U) in RNA.\n\n2. Translation: This step takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. The mRNA molecule produced in transcription carries the genetic code from the DNA to the ribosomes, where protein synthesis occurs. The mRNA molecule is read in groups of three nucleotides called codons. Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, each carrying a specific amino acid, bind to the codons on the mRNA through their anticodons. The ribosome facilitates the binding of tRNA molecules to the mRNA and catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds between the amino acids carried by the tRNA molecules. As the ribosome moves along the mRNA, a polypeptide chain is synthesized, with each amino acid being added to the growing chain in the order specified by the codons on the mRNA. This process continues until a stop codon is reached, signaling the end of protein synthesis.\n\nAfter translation, the newly synthesized polypeptide chain may undergo further modifications, such as folding into its functional three-dimensional structure or being cleaved into smaller functional units. The final protein product is then ready to carry out its specific functions in the cell."
