    "response": "The properties of light waves include:\n\n1. Wavelength: Light waves have a specific wavelength, which is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs of the wave. It is usually measured in nanometers (nm) or meters (m).\n\n2. Frequency: The frequency of a light wave is the number of complete cycles it completes in one second. It is measured in hertz (Hz) or cycles per second.\n\n3. Speed: Light waves travel at a constant speed in a vacuum, which is approximately 299,792 kilometers per second (km/s) or 186,282 miles per second (mi/s).\n\n4. Amplitude: The amplitude of a light wave is the maximum displacement of the wave from its equilibrium position. It determines the brightness or intensity of the light.\n\n5. Polarization: Light waves can be polarized, which means that the oscillations of the wave occur in a specific direction. This property is important in applications such as 3D glasses and polarized sunglasses.\n\n6. Reflection: Light waves can be reflected when they encounter a surface, changing their direction of propagation. This property is used in mirrors and other reflective surfaces.\n\n7. Refraction: Light waves can be refracted when they pass through a medium with a different refractive index, causing them to change direction. This property is used in lenses and prisms.\n\n8. Interference: Light waves can interfere with each other when they overlap, resulting in constructive or destructive interference. This property is used in applications such as diffraction gratings and interferometers.\n\n9. Diffraction: Light waves can diffract when they encounter an obstacle or pass through a narrow opening, causing them to spread out. This property is used in applications such as diffraction patterns and holography.\n\n10. Dispersion: Light waves can be dispersed when they pass through a medium with a varying refractive index, causing different wavelengths to separate. This property is used in applications such as rainbows and spectroscopy."
