    "response": "Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert glucose and oxygen into energy, carbon dioxide, and water. It occurs in three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n1. Glycolysis: This is the first stage of cellular respiration and takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. It begins with the breakdown of glucose, a six-carbon molecule, into two molecules of pyruvate, a three-carbon molecule. This process requires the input of two ATP molecules and produces four ATP molecules, resulting in a net gain of two ATP molecules. It also generates two molecules of NADH, which carry high-energy electrons.\n\n2. Citric Acid Cycle: The pyruvate molecules produced in glycolysis are transported into the mitochondria, where they undergo further breakdown in the citric acid cycle. Each pyruvate molecule is converted into acetyl-CoA, a two-carbon molecule, which enters the cycle. In the citric acid cycle, acetyl-CoA is oxidized, releasing carbon dioxide and transferring high-energy electrons to carrier molecules NADH and FADH2. These carrier molecules will be used in the next stage.\n\n3. Oxidative Phosphorylation: This is the final stage of cellular respiration and occurs in the inner membrane of the mitochondria. The high-energy electrons carried by NADH and FADH2 are transferred to the electron transport chain, a series of protein complexes embedded in the membrane. As the electrons pass through the chain, their energy is used to pump protons (H+) across the membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient. This gradient drives the synthesis of ATP through a process called chemiosmosis. At the end of the electron transport chain, the electrons combine with oxygen and protons to form water.\n\nOverall, cellular respiration produces a total of 36-38 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, depending on the efficiency of the process. The energy stored in ATP is then used by the cell for various metabolic activities, such as muscle contraction, active transport, and synthesis of molecules."
