    "response": "Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert glucose and oxygen into energy, carbon dioxide, and water. It occurs in three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), and oxidative phosphorylation (also known as the electron transport chain).\n\n1. Glycolysis: This is the first step of cellular respiration and occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. It does not require oxygen and can occur in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. During glycolysis, a molecule of glucose is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This process also produces a small amount of ATP and NADH.\n\n2. Citric Acid Cycle: If oxygen is present, the pyruvate molecules produced in glycolysis enter the mitochondria. In the mitochondrial matrix, each pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle. The citric acid cycle completes the breakdown of glucose by oxidizing acetyl-CoA to produce ATP, NADH, FADH2, and carbon dioxide.\n\n3. Oxidative Phosphorylation: The final stage of cellular respiration takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. NADH and FADH2 produced in glycolysis and the citric acid cycle donate their electrons to the electron transport chain. As the electrons pass through a series of protein complexes, energy is released and used to pump protons (H+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient. This gradient drives the synthesis of ATP through a process called chemiosmosis. Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor, combining with protons to form water.\n\nOverall, cellular respiration produces a net gain of 36-38 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, depending on the cell type and conditions. It is an essential process for providing energy to cells and is necessary for the functioning of all living organisms."
