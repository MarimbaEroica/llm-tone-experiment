    "response": "Digestion is the process by which the body breaks down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed and used for energy, growth, and repair. It involves several organs and enzymes working together to convert complex food substances into simpler forms that can be easily absorbed by the body.\n\nThe process of digestion begins in the mouth, where food is mechanically broken down by chewing and mixed with saliva. Saliva contains enzymes, such as amylase, which starts the breakdown of carbohydrates.\n\nOnce food is chewed and mixed with saliva, it is swallowed and travels down the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, food is mixed with gastric juices, including hydrochloric acid and enzymes like pepsin. These substances help break down proteins into smaller peptides.\n\nFrom the stomach, partially digested food enters the small intestine. The small intestine is the primary site of digestion and absorption. Here, the pancreas releases digestive enzymes, such as amylase, lipase, and proteases, which further break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, respectively. Bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, is also released into the small intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of fats.\n\nThe inner lining of the small intestine is covered in tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption. Nutrients, such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids, are absorbed through the villi and enter the bloodstream.\n\nThe remaining undigested food, along with water and waste products, moves into the large intestine. The large intestine absorbs water and electrolytes, while bacteria in the colon break down any remaining undigested food. This process produces gases, which are released as flatulence.\n\nFinally, the waste material, known as feces, is stored in the rectum until it is eliminated from the body through the anus during a bowel movement.\n\nOverall, digestion is a complex process that involves the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food, absorption of nutrients, and elimination of waste. It is essential for providing the body with the necessary nutrients for energy and maintaining overall health."
