    "response": "Sure! The process of digestion in the human body involves the breakdown of food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed and utilized by the body. It can be divided into several stages:\n\n1. Ingestion: The process begins with the intake of food through the mouth. The teeth and tongue help in chewing and mixing the food with saliva, which contains enzymes that start breaking down carbohydrates.\n\n2. Swallowing: Once the food is chewed and mixed with saliva, it is formed into a small, moist ball called a bolus. The bolus is then pushed to the back of the mouth and into the esophagus through swallowing.\n\n3. Peristalsis: The esophagus contracts in a wave-like motion called peristalsis, which pushes the bolus down towards the stomach. This movement is involuntary and helps move the food along the digestive tract.\n\n4. Stomach: The bolus enters the stomach, where it is mixed with gastric juices. The stomach secretes hydrochloric acid and enzymes like pepsin, which break down proteins. The stomach also churns the food, further breaking it down into a semi-liquid mixture called chyme.\n\n5. Small Intestine: The chyme then enters the small intestine, where most of the digestion and absorption of nutrients occur. The small intestine receives digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver, which help break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into smaller molecules. The inner lining of the small intestine contains tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption.\n\n6. Absorption: The small intestine absorbs the broken-down nutrients, such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids, into the bloodstream. These nutrients are then transported to various cells and organs in the body to provide energy and support various functions.\n\n7. Large Intestine: Any undigested food, water, and waste products that were not absorbed in the small intestine move into the large intestine. The large intestine absorbs water and electrolytes from the remaining material, forming feces.\n\n8. Elimination: The feces are stored in the rectum until they are eliminated from the body through the anus during a bowel movement.\n\nOverall, the process of digestion involves mechanical and chemical breakdown of food, absorption of nutrients, and elimination of waste products. It is a complex and coordinated process that ensures the body receives the necessary nutrients for energy and growth."
