    "response": "The process of digestion in the human body begins in the mouth, where food is broken down into smaller pieces through chewing and mixed with saliva. Saliva contains enzymes that start the breakdown of carbohydrates.\n\nThe food then travels down the esophagus and enters the stomach. In the stomach, the food is mixed with gastric juices, which contain enzymes and hydrochloric acid. The acid helps to break down proteins, while the enzymes continue the breakdown of carbohydrates.\n\nFrom the stomach, the partially digested food moves into the small intestine. Here, the pancreas releases digestive enzymes that further break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The liver also contributes by producing bile, which helps in the digestion and absorption of fats.\n\nThe small intestine is lined with tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption. Nutrients from the digested food are absorbed through the villi into the bloodstream. Carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars, proteins into amino acids, and fats into fatty acids and glycerol.\n\nThe remaining undigested food, along with water and waste products, move into the large intestine. In the large intestine, water is absorbed, and the waste material is formed into feces. The feces are then eliminated from the body through the rectum and anus.\n\nThroughout the process of digestion, various hormones are released to regulate the digestive process. For example, the hormone gastrin stimulates the release of gastric juices in the stomach, while the hormone cholecystokinin triggers the release of digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the gallbladder.\n\nOverall, the process of digestion involves the mechanical and chemical breakdown of food, absorption of nutrients, and elimination of waste products. It is a complex and coordinated process that ensures the body receives the necessary nutrients for energy and growth."
