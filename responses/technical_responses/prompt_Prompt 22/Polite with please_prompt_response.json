    "response": "World War I, also known as the Great War, was a global conflict that lasted from 1914 to 1918. It was triggered by a complex web of factors and events that culminated in the outbreak of war. Here are some of the key causes of World War I:\n\n1. Nationalism: The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed a rise in nationalism, where people developed strong loyalty and devotion to their own nation. This led to intense competition and rivalries between nations, as each sought to assert its dominance and protect its interests.\n\n2. Imperialism: European powers were engaged in a race to acquire colonies and expand their empires. This led to conflicts over territories and resources, particularly in Africa and Asia, as well as increased tensions between rival powers.\n\n3. Alliance System: In the years leading up to the war, European nations formed complex alliances to protect themselves and maintain a balance of power. The two main alliances were the Triple Entente (France, Russia, and Britain) and the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy initially, later joined by the Ottoman Empire).\n\n4. Militarism: There was a significant arms race among European powers, with countries investing heavily in their military capabilities. This led to the development of large standing armies, advanced weaponry, and a belief in the power of military might.\n\n5. Balkan Crisis: The Balkan region, comprising various ethnic and nationalist groups, was a hotbed of tensions and conflicts. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist in June 1914 triggered a series of events that eventually led to the outbreak of war.\n\n6. Failure of Diplomacy: Diplomatic efforts to resolve conflicts and prevent war were largely unsuccessful. The complex system of alliances, coupled with a lack of effective communication and negotiation, meant that diplomatic channels were unable to prevent the escalation of tensions.\n\n7. Failure of International Institutions: The existing international institutions, such as the League of Nations, were unable to effectively mediate disputes and maintain peace. This lack of a strong international framework contributed to the inability to prevent the outbreak of war.\n\nIt is important to note that these causes are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand acted as a catalyst, but the underlying tensions and rivalries between nations were already present. The combination of these factors ultimately led to the outbreak of World War I."
