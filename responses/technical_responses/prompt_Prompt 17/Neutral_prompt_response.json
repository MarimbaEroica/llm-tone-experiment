    "response": "Acids and bases have several properties that distinguish them from each other:\n\nAcids:\n1. Taste: Acids have a sour taste. For example, lemon juice and vinegar are both acidic and have a sour taste.\n2. pH: Acids have a pH value less than 7. The lower the pH value, the stronger the acid. For example, hydrochloric acid has a pH of 1, while lemon juice has a pH of around 2.\n3. Reactivity: Acids react with metals to produce hydrogen gas. They also react with bases to form salts and water.\n4. Conductivity: Acids are electrolytes, meaning they conduct electricity when dissolved in water.\n5. Turns litmus paper red: Acids turn blue litmus paper red.\n\nBases:\n1. Taste: Bases have a bitter taste. For example, baking soda has a bitter taste.\n2. pH: Bases have a pH value greater than 7. The higher the pH value, the stronger the base. For example, sodium hydroxide has a pH of 14, while baking soda has a pH of around 9.\n3. Reactivity: Bases react with acids to form salts and water. They also react with fats and oils to form soaps.\n4. Conductivity: Bases are electrolytes, meaning they conduct electricity when dissolved in water.\n5. Turns litmus paper blue: Bases turn red litmus paper blue."
