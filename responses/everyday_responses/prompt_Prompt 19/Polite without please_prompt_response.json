    "response": "I apologize, but I am an AI language model and do not have access to specific mailing lists or the ability to unsubscribe you from them. However, I can provide you with general guidance on how to unsubscribe from most mailing lists:\n\n1. Look for an \"Unsubscribe\" link: Most legitimate emails include an unsubscribe link at the bottom of the message. Click on it, and it should direct you to a page where you can unsubscribe.\n\n2. Check the email settings: Some emails may not have an unsubscribe link but provide instructions on how to manage your email preferences. Look for options like \"Manage Subscriptions\" or \"Email Preferences\" within the email.\n\n3. Reply to the email: If you can't find an unsubscribe link or email preferences, you can reply to the email and politely request to be removed from their mailing list. Make sure to include your email address and any other relevant information they may need to identify your subscription.\n\n4. Mark as spam: If the emails persist despite your attempts to unsubscribe, you can mark them as spam in your email client. This action may help filter future emails from that sender into your spam or junk folder.\n\nRemember, these steps may vary depending on the email service provider or the specific mailing list you want to unsubscribe from."
