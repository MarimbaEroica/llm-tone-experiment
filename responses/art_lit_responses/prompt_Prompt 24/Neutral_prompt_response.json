    "response": "Certainly! One highly recommended mystery novel is \"Gone Girl\" by Gillian Flynn. It is a gripping psychological thriller that follows the disappearance of Amy Dunne on her fifth wedding anniversary. The story is filled with twists, turns, and unreliable narrators, keeping readers on the edge of their seats until the very end."
