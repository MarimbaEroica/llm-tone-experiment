    "response": "Classical music is a broad term used to describe a genre of music that originated in Western traditions, primarily from the 11th to the 20th centuries. It encompasses a wide range of styles, forms, and periods. \n\nClassical music is characterized by its complexity, structure, and adherence to certain compositional techniques. It often features instrumental compositions, including symphonies, concertos, sonatas, and chamber music, but can also include vocal compositions such as operas, choral works, and art songs.\n\nOne of the defining features of classical music is its notation system, which allows composers to precisely notate their musical ideas. This has led to the preservation and transmission of classical music throughout history.\n\nClassical music is known for its emphasis on balance, clarity, and emotional expression. It often explores a wide range of moods and emotions, from joy and exuberance to sadness and introspection. It also incorporates various musical forms, such as sonata form, fugue, and theme and variations, which provide a framework for the composition.\n\nWhile the term \"classical\" is often used to refer specifically to the music of the Classical period (roughly 1750-1820), it is also used more broadly to encompass music from the Baroque, Romantic, and even modern periods. Classical music continues to be performed and appreciated by audiences worldwide, and its rich heritage has had a profound influence on many other genres of music."
