They might question the artistic merit of certain works or feel disconnected from the abstract or conceptual nature of some pieces. Some critics argue that modern art can be overly focused on shock value or novelty, lacking the technical skill or aesthetic appeal found in more traditional art forms.\n\nUltimately, opinions on modern art vary greatly, and appreciation of it often depends on personal taste, cultural background, and individual experiences.
