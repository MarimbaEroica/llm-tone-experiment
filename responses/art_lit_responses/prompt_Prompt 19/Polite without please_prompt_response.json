    "response": "As an AI language model, I don't have personal opinions or preferences. However, the title of the greatest playwright of all time is subjective and varies depending on individual perspectives and cultural contexts. Many consider William Shakespeare to be one of the greatest playwrights due to his profound impact on the English language and his timeless works such as \"Romeo and Juliet,\" \"Hamlet,\" and \"Macbeth.\" Other notable playwrights often mentioned as contenders for this title include Henrik Ibsen, Anton Chekhov, Tennessee Williams, and Arthur Miller, among others. Ultimately, the choice of the greatest playwright is a matter of personal taste and interpretation."
